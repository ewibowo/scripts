Most likely, this means you have an outdated version of Homebrew-Cask. Please run:

    brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew untap phinze/cask; brew untap caskroom/cask; brew update; brew cleanup; brew cask cleanup

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.


Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib

A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system

  /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries

A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl/certs

and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your

######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Caveats
Please note that upstream has asked us to make explicit managing
nvm via Homebrew is unsupported by them and you should check any
problems against the standard nvm install method prior to reporting.

You should create NVM's working directory if it doesn't exist:

  mkdir ~/.nvm

Add the following to ~/.zshrc or your desired shell
configuration file:

  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  . "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh"

You can set $NVM_DIR to any location, but leaving it unchanged from
/usr/local/Cellar/nvm/0.32.0 will destroy any nvm-installed Node installations
upon upgrade/reinstall.

Type `nvm help` for further information.

  You will need your previous PostgreSQL installation from brew to perform `pg_upgrade`.
  Do not run `brew cleanup postgresql` until you have performed the migration.

Under some circumstances, emacs and ctags can conflict. By default,
emacs provides an executable `ctags` that would conflict with the
executable of the same name that ctags provides. To prevent this,
Homebrew removes the emacs `ctags` and its manpage before linking.

However, if you install emacs with the `--keep-ctags` option, then
the `ctags` emacs provides will not be removed. In that case, you
won't be able to install ctags successfully. It will build but not
link.

The native FFmpeg AAC encoder has been stable since FFmpeg 3.0. If you
were using libvo-aacenc or libaacplus, both of which have been dropped in
FFmpeg 3.0, please consider switching to the native encoder (-c:a aac),
fdk-aac (-c:a libfdk_aac, ffmpeg needs to be installed with the
--with-fdk-aac option), or faac (-c:a libfaac, ffmpeg needs to be
installed with the --with-faac option).

See the announcement
https://ffmpeg.org/index.html#removing_external_aac_encoders for details,
and https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/AAC on best practices of encoding
AAC with FFmpeg.

  brew cask install wireshark-chmodbpf

This creates an 'access_bpf' group and adds a launch daemon that changes the
permissions of your BPF devices so that all users in that group have both
read and write access to those devices.

The Neovim executable is called 'nvim'. To use your existing Vim
configuration:
    ln -s ~/.vim ~/.config/nvim
    ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
See ':help nvim' for more information on Neovim.

When upgrading Neovim, check the following page for breaking changes:
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Following-HEAD

If you want support for Python plugins such as YouCompleteMe, you need
to install a Python module in addition to Neovim itself.

See ':help provider-python' or this page for more information:
    http://neovim.io/doc/user/provider.html

If you have any questions, have a look at:
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ.

Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!

Warning: Putting non-prefixed coreutils in your path can cause gmp builds to fail.

Warning: Unbrewed header files were found in /usr/local/include.
If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when
building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.

Unexpected header files:
    /usr/local/include/python2.7/greenlet/greenlet.h

Warning: Some installed formula are missing dependencies.
You should `brew install` the missing dependencies:
  brew install doxygen

Run `brew missing` for more details.
