#If builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
#you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
#  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/2510
#
#To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.0) of PostgreSQL, see:
#  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/upgrading.html
#
#To migrate existing data from a previous minor version (9.0-9.4) of PosgresSQL, see:
#  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/pgupgrade.html
#
#  You will need your previous PostgreSQL installation from brew to perform `pg_upgrade`.
#  Do not run `brew cleanup postgresql` until you have performed the migration.
#
#To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
#  brew services start postgresql
#Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
#  postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

#   pg_ctl -D postgres -l logfile start
